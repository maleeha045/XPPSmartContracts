## Methods

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-allowance}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| owner | address | undefined |
| spender | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-approve}. NOTE: If `value` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on `transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| value | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-balanceOf}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### burn

```solidity
function burn(uint256 value) external nonpayable
```



*Destroys a `value` amount of tokens from the caller. See {ERC20-_burn}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| value | uint256 | undefined |

### burnFrom

```solidity
function burnFrom(address account, uint256 value) external nonpayable
```



*Destroys a `value` amount of tokens from `account`, deducting from the caller&#39;s allowance. See {ERC20-_burn} and {ERC20-allowance}. Requirements: - the caller must have allowance for ``accounts``&#39;s tokens of at least `value`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | undefined |
| value | uint256 | undefined |

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8)
```



*Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation. For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`). Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless it&#39;s overridden. NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint8 | undefined |

### mint

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external nonpayable
```





#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| to | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

### name

```solidity
function name() external view returns (string)
```



*Returns the name of the token.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

### owner

```solidity
function owner() external view returns (address)
```



*Returns the address of the current owner.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() external nonpayable
```



*Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call `onlyOwner` functions. Can only be called by the current owner. NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby disabling any functionality that is only available to the owner.*


### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string)
```



*Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the name.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | undefined |

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-totalSupply}.*

| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-transfer}. Requirements: - `to` cannot be the zero address. - the caller must have a balance of at least `value`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| to | address | undefined |
| value | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-transferFrom}. Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``&#39;s tokens of at least `value`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| from | address | undefined |
| to | address | undefined |
| value | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external nonpayable
```



*Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`). Can only be called by the current owner.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newOwner | address | undefined |



## Events

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)
